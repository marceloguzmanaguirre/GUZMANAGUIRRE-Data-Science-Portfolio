## This is my "Intro to Data Science" Portfolio Repository! üßëüèª‚Äçüî¨
<em>This repository contains projects and assignments for "Introduction to Data Science" at the University of Notre Dame (Spring 2025). The portfolio demonstrates skills in data analysis, visualization, machine learning, and ethical AI applications using Python. Also, this is where I'll keep my regular homework organized; I'm a firm believer that every assignment will help build toward my larger portfolio pieces while letting me practice specific skills.

### Exploratory Data Analysis üßê
I'll use this directory for all my data cleaning exercises and visualization work. I'll be practicing with Pandas and Seaborn here, storing both my raw data inputs and cleaned outputs, along with the visualization code I develop. This will be crucial for building my foundational data skills.

### Machine Learning üìñ  
As I progress through supervised and unsupervised learning techniques, I'll organize my work here. I'll start with my basic regression models and build up to more complex clustering projects. Each project will include my model code, evaluation metrics, and documentation of my learning process.

## üîç At a Glance: Portfolio Projects

This section summarizes all major deliverables completed for *Introduction to Data Science* (Spring 2025), organized by update.

### üóÇÔ∏è [NYC Air Quality Database Explorer](https://github.com/marceloguzmanaguirre/GUZMANAGUIRRE-Data-Science-Portfolio/tree/main/basic_streamlit_app)
A basic Streamlit app (using `main.py`) that lets users filter air quality data by pollutant, location, and measurement range. My first hands-on experience with interactive data exploration.

### üóÇÔ∏è [Tidy Data Project](https://github.com/marceloguzmanaguirre/GUZMANAGUIRRE-Data-Science-Portfolio/tree/main/TidyData-Project)
Built in Jupyter (`FinalProject.ipynb`), this project cleans and reshapes messy federal R&D data using regex and melt operations. It includes Seaborn visualizations of temporal trends.

### üóÇÔ∏è [Supervised ML App](https://github.com/marceloguzmanaguirre/GUZMANAGUIRRE-Data-Science-Portfolio/tree/main/MLStreamlitApp)
An interactive Streamlit app (`app.py`) for training and evaluating logistic regression and decision tree models. Users can upload data, choose features, and visualize model performance.

### üóÇÔ∏è [Unsupervised ML App](https://github.com/marceloguzmanaguirre/GUZMANAGUIRRE-Data-Science-Portfolio/tree/main/MLUnsupervisedApp)
Final project (`MLUnsupervisedApp.py`) focused on clustering and dimensionality reduction. Includes KMeans, PCA, and Hierarchical Clustering with visual tools like elbow plots and dendrograms.
