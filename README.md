## This is my "Intro to Data Science" Portfolio Repository! 🧑🏻‍🔬
<em>This repository contains projects and assignments for "Introduction to Data Science" at the University of Notre Dame (Spring 2025). The portfolio demonstrates skills in data analysis, visualization, machine learning, and ethical AI applications using Python. Also, this is where I'll keep my regular homework organized; I'm a firm believer that every assignment will help build toward my larger portfolio pieces while letting me practice specific skills.</em>

### 🧐 Exploratory Data Analysis 🧐  
Throughout this course, I developed foundational skills in cleaning and visualizing real-world datasets using **Pandas**, **Regex**, and **Seaborn**. These skills were essential to preparing data for machine learning and drawing meaningful insights.

#### 🧼 Data Cleaning  
<details><summary> I learned to transform raw, messy datasets into tidy, structured formats that support reproducible analysis. Key techniques included: </summary>
- Extracting information from strings using **regular expressions**
- Reshaping datasets using `melt()` and `pivot()`
- Handling missing values and ensuring consistent variable formatting
- Creating new variables through **feature engineering**
</details>

#### 📊 Data Visualization  
I used plotting libraries like **Seaborn** and **Matplotlib** to explore relationships, identify trends, and communicate findings. My visualizations emphasized:
<details><summary>
- **Time series** and **trend analysis** with line plots and scatterplots  
- **Distribution analysis** with KDEs, histograms, and boxplots  
- Highlighting group-level comparisons using color and facetting  
- Supporting insight-driven narratives through annotation and layout design
</summary></details>

<details><summary>
Key skills – <em>Data wrangling, string parsing, feature creation, and visualization for exploration and communication</em>
</summary></details>

### Machine Learning 📖  
Across multiple projects, I applied both supervised and unsupervised learning techniques using **Scikit-learn**, **Pandas**, and **Streamlit**, focusing on building user-interactive apps and interpreting model performance.

#### 🔹 Supervised Learning  
I worked with models like **Logistic Regression** and **Decision Trees** to build classification pipelines. I gained experience in:
<details><summary>
- Uploading and preprocessing user data  
- Model training and prediction  
- Performance evaluation with **confusion matrices** and **classification reports**  
- Deploying models in interactive Streamlit apps
</summary></details>

#### 🔹 Unsupervised Learning  
I implemented clustering and dimensionality reduction techniques to explore patterns in unlabeled data. Key methods included:
<details><summary>
- **KMeans** and **Hierarchical Clustering**  
- **PCA** for reducing dimensions and improving interpretability  
- Visualization techniques such as **elbow plots**, **dendrograms**, and **2D PCA projections**
</summary></details>

<details><summary>
Key skills – <em>Model evaluation, clustering, dimensionality reduction, UI-driven deployment</em>
